# Decision-Theoretic Modeling of Binocular Rivalry using POMDPs

This is a 6-month project done in collaboration with Dr. Shervin Safavi, Dr. Kevin Lloyd and Dr. Andrew Webb at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics at the department for Computational Neuroscience of Prof. Dr. Peter Dayan. 

The goal of this project was to model binocular rivalry as a decision-theoretic model using reinforcement learning methods. The model used for this approach is the Partially Observable Markov Decision-Processes (POMDP) model.
